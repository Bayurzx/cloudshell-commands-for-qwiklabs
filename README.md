# cloudshell-commands-for-qwiklabs

This repository assists user to complete qwiklab assignments from the cloud shell, or using google cloud SDK, without using the GCP UI.

There are additional bash files included in this repository, referred to in the instructions as **"bash assistance"** 

**"bash assistance"** prompts the student to enter only the necessary details for a task, and completes the defaults for the student.
I've included this for Introductory level labs and shorter duration labs (Creating virtual machines, Data to insights: ingesting and querying new datasets 1.1)

The purpose of bash assistance to retain the diffulty level of the qwiklab, and 

to reduce time spent on a task so that the student can complete the task in the same amount of time as he/she would using the web console.
